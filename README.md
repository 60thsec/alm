# TypeScript Builder ðŸŒ¹
![TypeScript Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basarat/tsb/master/resources/icon.png)

Gives complete dev environment for TypeScript from *creation* all the way down to *deployment* that is:

* easy to install
* easy to use

**Why TypeScript?**

You can build *complete* applications with a single language > this means you can have dev tools (like this) that can understand *your entire project*.

**Why another IDE (not atom / vscode / brackets)?**

Fundamental differences:
* This is TypeScript first. We want to provide the **greatest** development and analysis experience for TypeScript. Every UI component used needs to revolve around this goal.
* [Super easy to setup](https://github.com/TypeScriptBuilder/tsb/tree/master#usage). Just `npm install` and open your browser.

There are lots of [other reasons why you might use this project OR use the source code](https://github.com/basarat/tsb/blob/master/docs/contributing/why.md). Effectively this is `transpiler`, `editor`, `analyzer`, `DX workflow` rolled into one.

## Usage
Get it:
```
npm install tsb -g
```

Run it from the directory you want to serve up:
```
tsb
```

Now open it in your favorite browser (pssst `chrome`) at the URL mentioned in your console.
