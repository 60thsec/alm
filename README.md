# TypeScript Builder ðŸŒ¹
![TypeScript Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basarat/tsb/master/resources/icon.png)

Gives complete dev environment/editor for TypeScript all the way down to *deployment* that is: 

* easy to install
* easy to use

Why TypeScript? [Here are few reasons](http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/why-typescript.html). Also you can build *complete* applications with a single language > this means you can have dev tools (like this) that can understand *your entire project*.

## Usage 
Get it: 
```
npm install tsb -g
```

Run it from the directory you want to serve up: 
```
tsb
```

Now open it in your favorite browser (pssst `chrome`) at the URL mentioned in your console.

## Why 
* Works the same on the *server* as your local file system. Remote editing FTW!
* Heck..you can check in the IDE as a `devDependency`!
* Like cloud9 ... but on your server!
