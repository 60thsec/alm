# File paths
* `fileName`: just the file name e.g `foo.ts`
* `filePath`: Full path e.g. `c:/dev/foo.ts`
* `relativeFilePath`: relative to project e.g.`dev/foo.ts`

# File contents
* `contents` : The string `string` content of a file.
* `text` : The `string:[]` contents split by a newline. This is the model followed by codemirror as well.
