# Deployment

Once you are happy with the code:
* Just run [`npm version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) : `npm version major` OR `npm version minor` OR `npm version patch`.
* Write release notes on Github https://github.com/alm-tools/alm/releases.

> You must have `git` on your system path for this to work.

## Release Guidelines
* Be sure to mention any breaking changes at least ðŸŒ¹.
* TypeScript version upgrades should be considered at least a minor release. Try to link to reasons for upgrading TypeScript (some new cool feature or fix you wanted).
* If there is a significant change in the TypeScript compiler consider doing a major release.

## *Internals* of the Deployment System ðŸŒ¹
*Just for record on how this was setup*

We have an npm `postversion` script setup to run `git push --follow-tags` which pushes the npm version stuff to github. Then we have travis to automatically deploy **tagged commits** to NPM if tests succeed.

*How travis was setup*

* Add a .travis.yml file
* Toggle switch on travis using https://travis-ci.org/
* NPM deploy setup by simply running `travis setup npm` (you get `travis` from `gem install travis`). Then setup the API key using https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8970#issuecomment-122854271
* `all_branches` in `.travis.yml` is set to `true` because of https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1675#issuecomment-37851765
