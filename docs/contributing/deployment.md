# Deployment
Once you are happy with the code:
* Just run [`npm version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) : `npm version major` OR `npm version minor` OR `npm version patch`.
* Push the outcome to github (`git push --follow-tags`).
* Write release notes on Github https://github.com/alm-tools/alm/releases.

> Travis will automatically deploy **tagged commits** (generated by `npm version`) to NPM if tests succeed.

## Release Guidelines
* Be sure to mention any breaking changes at least ðŸŒ¹.
* TypeScript version upgrades should be considered at least a minor release. Try to link to reasons for upgrading TypeScript (some new cool feature or fix you wanted).
* If there is a significant change in the TypeScript compiler consider doing a major release.
