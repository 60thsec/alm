> Not all these features might be pushed to npm yet. Remember the planned release is 2017 :rose:

## Focus
No matter where you are, `esc` will always take you to the currently focused editor, so you can do what you do best, **write code**.

## Jumpy
Just press `shift+enter` and you can jump anywhere in the current editor.

## Errors

We don't just lint your current file, *we do the entire active project*. No black magic needed.

## Syntax Highlighting
Not just another text mate based grammar which [despite a lot of love](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage/blob/ab17d24fed148cd789fd632d74f170c7308d75ff/TypeScriptReact.tmLanguage) can still fall short. Compare

#### Us

This is because *we use the exact same code that TypeScript uses to carry out its blazing fast compile*.

## Rename Refactoring
Start a rename refactoring and we show you an easy to view list of things that will change.

And if its a local change we will even allow you to do it inline.
