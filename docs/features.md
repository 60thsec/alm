# Sublime
> Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery

Sublime users will feel right at home as they get to use all their favorite features as it is e.g. `Mod + P` (find file), `Mod + Shift + P` (find command), `Mod + /` (comment uncomment code), `Mod + D` (select next match) and even `Alt + Shift + ⇅` for column selection

# Disk Watching
> The file on disk will set you free

You can use this side by side with your favorite editor.

# Multi Monitor
Need to use more than one monitor? Just open a new browser window! As many as you like, cause they all sync up!

# Focus
No matter where you are, `esc` will always take you to the currently focused editor, so you can do what you do best, **write code**.

# Jumpy
Just press `shift+enter` and you can jump anywhere in the current editor.

# OmniSearch
Single place for common search queries

> Search for `Editor` in the command search (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `⌘ + Shift + P`) to see all the shortcuts at your disposal.

# Errors

We don't just lint your current file, *we do the entire active project*. No black magic needed.

# Syntax Highlighting
Not just another text mate based grammar which [despite a lot of love](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage/blob/ab17d24fed148cd789fd632d74f170c7308d75ff/TypeScriptReact.tmLanguage) can still fall short. Compare:

### Us

This is because *we use the exact same code that TypeScript uses to carry out its blazing fast compile*.

# Rename Refactoring
Start a rename refactoring and we show you an easy to view list of things that will change.

And if its a local change we will even allow you to do it inline.

# Matching
Matching tags and brackets and words are highlighted automatically, this means less searching, more doing

# Doctor
All the joys of inline information without the frustrations of keyboard shortcut, shifting text or dialog overloads. Toggle : `Ctrl|⌘ + '`

# Goto Definition

Easy as `Ctrl|⌘ + B`

# Find References

Easy as `Ctrl|⌘ + Shift + B`
