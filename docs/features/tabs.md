# Tabs
We try to be as familiar as possible and work hard to make sure that `alm` can be used to complement any of your other editors. Please note that these commands can always be searched from with [OmniSearch Command Mode][omnisearch].

* Close tab : press the `x` OR center click the tab OR `Alt + W`
* Undo close tab `Shift + Alt + W`
* GoTo Tab: `Ctrl|⌘ + <number>` e.g. `Ctrl|⌘ + 1` to go to the first tab
* GoTo Next Tab: `Alt + K`
* GoTo Previous Tab: `Alt + J`

# Multi Monitor
You can open the browser as many times as you want and we keep them all in sync!

We even have a handy dandy shortcut for duplicating the current browser window :

* Duplicate Window : `Ctrl|⌘ + Alt + D`
